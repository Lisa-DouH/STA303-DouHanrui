# Linear Mixed Model Assumptions

Linear mixed models assume that:
1. There is a continuous response variable.
2. We have modelled the dependency structure correctly (i.e. made correct choices about our random variables).
3. Our units/subjects are independent, even through observations within each subject are taken not to to be.
4. Both the random effects and within-unit residual errors follow normal distributions.
5. The random effects errors and within-unit residual errors have constant variance .
